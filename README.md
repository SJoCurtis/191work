#**Report For Week Two Homework**
##*Jo Curtis*
To be honest, this week has been wild. Full of self doubt and uncertainty, but also a sincere intrigue with all the content we have been discussing. I have been wildly confused, as well as wildly curious. At times I have felt very confident, and at others I have felt myself sinking into the pit of confusion induced apathy. Only to return a moment later as sure of what I'm doing as ever. Good times.
##Problems Ive Encountered
- Having the brain of a sloth. I take forever to learn new things and develop skills. ~~It took me until senior year to sort of understand the mutiplications table. Im Cuban, I failed Spanish twice.~~ Its okay though, me and my slow mind will survive.
- Deleting important stuff. Im a _neat freak_, I like to keep my computer cashes very tidy and as empty and possible. Thus I go through and delete ~~shit~~ stuff a lot and often its important. I did it the second I left class on Wednesday and screwed with everything, so yeah. I had to restart on my own.
- Time management. My spirit animal is the sloth, I'm literally slow at everything. I always feel real zenned and chilled out so I wait forever to do anything pressing. Thus Im always scrambling at the last moment. _Chill_.
> Im fine.
## Successes Ive Had
- Not combusting. Ive been known to sort of implode when Im stressed. Never externally, I just sort of sit there internally screaming. Has yet to happen, ~~but it will.~~
- Not entirely failing at everything and giving up because I suck.
- Haven't set laptop on fire yet.... Ive thought about it. Ive resisted the urge.
> Im fine.
