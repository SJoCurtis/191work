#**Report For Week Two Homework**
##*Jo Curtis*
To be honest, this week has been wild. Full of self doubt and uncertainty, but also a sincere intrigue with all the content we have been discussing. I have been wildly confused, as well as wildly curious. At times I have felt very confident, and at others I have felt myself sinking into the pit of confusion induced apathy. Only to return a moment later as sure of what I'm doing as ever. Good times.
##Problems Ive Encountered
- Having the brain of a sloth. I take forever to learn new things and develop skills. ~~It took me until senior year to sort of understand the mutiplications table. Im Cuban, I failed Spanish twice.~~ Its okay though, me and my slow mind will survive.
- Deleting important stuff. Im a _neat freak_, I like to keep my computer cashes very tidy and as empty as possible. Thus I go through and delete stuff a lot, and often its important. I did it the second I left class on Wednesday and screwed with everything, so yeah. I had to restart on my own.
- Time management. My spirit animal is the sloth, I'm literally slow at everything. I always feel real zenned and chilled out so I wait forever to do anything pressing. Thus Im always scrambling at the last moment. _Chill_.

## Successes I've Had
- Not combusting. I've been known to sort of implode when I'm stressed. Never externally, I just sort of sit there internally screaming. Has yet to happen, ~~but it will.~~
- Not entirely failing at everything and giving up because I suck.
- Haven't set laptop on fire yet.... I've thought about it. I've resisted the urge.

### Things I've "Learned"
```
cd to travel change directories
ls to list all the stuff in that specific directory
mkdir to make a new directory
touch to create a new file
```
1. Ive also learned what terminal itself is capable of.
2. Also how to access all the hidden files on my computer.
- I highly recommend leaving these mostly alone.

## The Required Link to Another Site
I didn't know what to do,[so I put the link to an article discussing absurdism in post-modern art.](https://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/36/absurdism-in-post-modern-art-examining-the-interplay-between-waiting-for-godot-and-extremely-loud-and-incredibly-close) Im an absurdist, so why the heck not. Everyone can enjoy.
