# Hw-3 Review
  So, if I'm being real honest. Which I am, I created the drawing on Saturday and have been doing this quickly tonight on Sunday. Real quick like. I underestimated the time it would take for me to complete all of the steps. I procrastinated, and thus the results are sub-par to what I could have done. Alas, it is what it is. I set out having a more elaborate idea in mind, but I didn't understand how much time it would take.
## What Worked
- Mostly everything, I didn't have very many problems with this assignment besides time.
- Everything I did do was produced easily.
## What Didint
- My motivation to create something more cool and elaborate.
- Not giving myself enough time to work on this.
## References
- I basically just used your sketch.js as an outline to follow. I just manipulated and changed some things to better suit me.
## Discoveries
- Im lame and didn't have any great discoveries other than that I can be an awful student. WO0H0o.
