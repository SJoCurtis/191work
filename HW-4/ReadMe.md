#**Report For Homework Four: Basic Animation
##Jo Curtis
Ill be honest,I have no idea what I'm doing. I'm feeling quite lost and confused. I know that this isn't that complex yet, and yet, I am struggling. Ive had a lot going on in life and haven't had as much time as I would like to have to focus on my coding work. Thus I feel like I am behind somehow. Scraping by, doing the assignment and not really excelling. I want this to change. It is a goal. I just hope I dont get so confused and lost Im hopeless.
##What I learned
  - I learned that you should dedicate at least five minutes a day to looking at code or trying something out.
  -I learned that I still don't quite understand variable.
  -I learned how some interesting things Ive seen before were actually created.
