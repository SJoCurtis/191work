#**Report On Week Six Homework**
##*Jo Curtis*
I was excited after this last weeks lessons. I felt very inspired. Thus I went home and watched a buuunchhh of Youtube videos that dealt with conditionals and GUI aspects. I saw most people were choosing to do a 'button' as there GUI but I wanted to play around with the slider option. Which I think is super cool. So I basically just looked up "how to create generative art with a slider" and found lots of helpful resources.
## What Helped
Youtube. Youtube was my best friend for this assignment.
