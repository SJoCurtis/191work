#**Report For Week 5 Homework**
##*Jo Curtis*
This week was really hard, and I had no idea what I was doing. I still need to practice considering I have no idea what I am doing, and I'm just sort of flailing around in the ocean of code. Potentially drowning soon if I don't take more time to practice.
##Things That Helped
- videos. Lots of videos. I watched several Youtube videos on algorithmic or generative art. I also watched a fe vimeo videos for p5.js
- Other peoples sketch.js, I have such a hard time making anything work without reference, I really need to work on that. I try and alter others code to my own liking and aesthetic but its a personal goal to create something entirely on my own without reference.
