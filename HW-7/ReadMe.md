#Report For Homework Seven: Functions
## Jo Curtis
I've enjoyed learning about functions. Now that we have functions sort of down, it will make creating dynamic pieces a lot easier. functions are going to prove to make coding projects a lot easier. They make everything more modular and also a lot more reusable. Of course functions can be tricky, but so can everything code related. Ultimatly, functions are really helpful though, and essential.
## What I learned
  - How to utilize functions in a way that promotes modularity and reusableness.
  - Functions are really helpful, occasionally frustrating, but overall necessary for the progression of our coding experience.
## What Helped
- The videos about functions
- The fact that we were adding on to an existing project.
