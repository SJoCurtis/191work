# Report For Homework eight: Basic classes and arrays.

## Jo Curtis

To be honest, I really liked this assignment. I created several super rad looking sketches.
It took a bit to get it how I wanted it exactly but overall I thought it was a success.
## What Helped
The Youtube video definitely helped but the thing that helped the most was the work day in class.
I liked being able to talk to my peers about the code and easily get advice from them. Working alongside other person made it a lot easier I think.
## What I struggled with
Time management as per usual. Not devoting enough time to do what I really had in mind to begin with.
